# HTTP-HTTPS-Server-
Implemented a Web Proxy Server. It was designed to respond to http and https requests and should display each request on a management console. It should forward the request to the web server and relay the response to the browser, block the selected URLâ€™s via the management console and handle multiple requests simultaneously.
